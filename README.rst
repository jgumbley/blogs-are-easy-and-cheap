Blogs are Easy and Free
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the source of Jim Gumbley's blog source / scripts.

Blogs are low write high read web applications, which are infrequently updated by lets assume, a single person. The first thing we do is make the origin request cheap, i.e. no database calls, state or application stack. The second thing we almost get for free is using the power of HTTP and a content delivery network to cache the response, just in case HackerNews, Slashdot, or Mumsnet link to your self referencing inane prose. The technologies I've described are so insanely cheap nowadays that you can get all of this for free.
