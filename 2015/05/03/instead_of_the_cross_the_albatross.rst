    Abraham Karem an Isreali engineer started working on drones in the 70s.

During the cold war the United States established a technological research organisation called DARPA to "prevent strategic surprise". In 1982 they provided a grant to a aerospace engineer called Abraham Karem, trying to build reliable robotic aircraft that could fly for very long periods at high altitude. Karem had moved to the United States after working for the Isreali Airforce building decoy rockets that could pinpoint enemy antiaircraft defences during the 1973 Yom Kippur war. 

The CIA started to operationalise Karem's drones in the early nineties. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the US military intervened in Yugoslavia, a former Soviet Soviet satellite. The Gnat 750 drone was able to relay live reconnaissance feeds to the Pentagon via a relay aircraft and satellite ground stations. Over the next ten years Karem's team, now working at a firm called General Atomics, enhanced the drones endurance and imaging capabilities and incorporated direct satellite links.
