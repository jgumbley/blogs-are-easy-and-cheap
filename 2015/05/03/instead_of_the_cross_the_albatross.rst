    Abraham Karem an Isreali engineer started working on drones in the 70s.

During the cold war the United States established a technological research organisation called DARPA to "prevent strategic surprise". In 1982 they provided a grant to a aerospace engineer called Abraham Karem, trying to build reliable robotic aircraft that could fly for very long periods at high altitude. Karem had moved to the United States after working for the Isreali Airforce building decoy rockets that could pinpoint enemy antiaircraft defences during the 1973 Yom Kippur war. 

The CIA started to operationalise Karem's drones in the early nineties. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the US military intervened in Yugoslavia, a former Soviet Soviet satellite. The Gnat 750 drone was able to relay live reconnaissance feeds to the Pentagon via a relay aircraft and satellite ground stations. Over the next ten years Karem's team, now working at a firm called General Atomics, enhanced the drones by significantly improving their endurance and imaging capabilities and incorporating direct satellite links.

    September 11th motivated the drones becoming an assasination as well as reconnaissance platform.

After a critical US Congress commitee report in the mid-seventies the CIA had been banned from assasination operations in sovereign foreign territory. After September 11th the US executive signed a memorandum ordering the CIA to find and kill the leaders of the group of Islamic fundamentalists who had carried out the attacks. This executive order combined with the US interventionist wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has led to an enourmous growth in the use of drones as an assasination as well as reconnaissance platforms.

The predator drone, or General Atomics MQ-1 is a development of the Gnat 750 capable of travelling over 400 miles to a target, loitering for upto 14 hours and then returning to base. Unlike the Gnat, predators are equipped with Hellfire missiles, a relatively cheap air-to-surface missile developed in the 1980s to attack tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The operator of the predator uses a targetting laser beamed from the drone to guide the hellfire at its intended target. Despite being designed as an anti-tank missile the hellfire is an effective anti-personnel weapon.
