Simple homebrew fridge
======================

Today I just wanted to get started with homebrew beer. In my work I see the IT industry all the time overengineering and doing big design, or discovery, or planning up front. Get started! You'll learn more by doing than you will by planning.

For Christmas I was bought pre-<process> mix with hops added. This is recommended in a number of books and articles as the best place to start, as you are focussing on the fermentation stage only.

However, I decided that I did want to regulate temperture. Firstly, I live in the UK and it cold. The instructions for the kit currently say to leave the homebrew to ferment for two weeks at '22 degress celcius'. There is probably nowhere in house which is this warm.

Brewpi is complex, need to buy all kinds of equipment.
