What has this blog been like until now, what do I want it to be like.
=====================================================================

So far on this blog I have not managed to complete a single one of the longish mini-essays which I've been tempted to write. The subjects have been consistent however, in being, rather than nonsense about IT, bits of details on topics which take my particular interest from time to time. The quality of the prose I suppose I am happy enough with, but structurally each blog entry is either complete with the content remaining in note form, or in coherent enough paragraphs, then tailing off without being complete. I have struggled somewhat to complete anything.

Following on from this, I might take a moment to wonder about the potential audience of this blog. It is on the internet, therefore anyone can read it, however the titles so far have been such that someone coming across it by chance is less likely. I might try more literal titles as I want any readers to be random people rather than people who are nosing at me by i.e. Googling my name and following the link to my blog. In fact I would be happy not to have any readers at all, such as my `Sentence Fragments <http://sentence-fragments.blogspot.co.uk/>`_ blog which I added to for years without, so far as I hope, a single reader.

And so, short articles with literal titles on things which have been interesting me. Much more like the sentence fragements one, but perhaps a little less 'earnest' in tone.
