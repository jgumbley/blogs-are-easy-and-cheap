What is DevOps anyhow? Am I one?
================================

So I heard that a project would have delivered earlier if they had implemented DevOps sooner. Their development team had a great velocity in delivering feature points but they hit a brick wall on the final mile to production, so in the end they opted for a full DevOps team.  DevOps is a software development methodology, a response to the interdependency between development and operations, a poorly executed scam, an extension of the lean startup revolution and a natural reaction to cloud infrastructure and virtualisation. People search Google and buy DevOps in a box from $395 per year. DevOps is a culture of collaboration and if something on your production stack breaks in the middle of the night then you should DevOps it. If your app locks up in performance test then that's DevOps. Most importantly, any modern Project Manager knows that no Agile team is complete without a DevOps- and good developers can do DevOps. Some developers even do DevOps full time. DevOps is the new normal.

Obviously some or all of the preceding paragraph is nonsense and that's fine. There are a couple of things going on the industry which are interesting and the silly DevOps word simply helps people to talk about these things. Instead of making some grandiose statements trying to pithily capture the essence of these themes and changes I will instead make some comments of my own which may or may not have any value. This is my blog and frankly I can do as I please. So DevOps has something to do with software, and in most cases where I am familiar with it, software which you can interact with over a computer network. It is less concerned with the functionality of this software, but rather ensuring that the networked software operates effectively. Operating anything effectively requires people, care, colloboration and is likely to shake out issues like allowing change and ensuring security. So really what more is there to be said.

Well what about the Dev? If DevOps is just an odd shaped work which connotes or implies the operation of networked software then why embarrass ourselves by saying DevOps, surely Ops will do? This is pretty simple, but there are broadly two directions it can take us. The first is that the work is showing that Dev(elopers) and Op(erations folks) are working together. Yeah you do want your people developing features to talk to your people ensuring the networked software operated effectively as there is a lot of detail to colloborate on if things are going to work out. My much preferred interpretation of the "Dev" part of "DevOps" is that it refers to the development of software tools which facilitate the operation of networked software. So we're not starting from feature development and mixing the Ops in (although that is great), we just take an approach to effectively operating networked software by developing software tools. Dev is the approach to Ops.

Having decided that DevOps is an odd shaped word which connotes or implies the operation of networked software by the development of software tools,  I ask if I am DevOps? Yes I am, because I've done that stuff, but no thanks, call me an Infrastructure Developer instead. And don't expect me not to do a bit of backend development, frontend development and project management stuff also from time to time.
