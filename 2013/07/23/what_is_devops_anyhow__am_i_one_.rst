What is DevOps anyhow? Am I one?
================================

So I heard that a project would have delivered earlier if they had implemented DevOps sooner. Their development team had a great velocity in delivering feature points but they hit a brick wall on the final mile to production, so in the end they opted for a full DevOps team.  DevOps is a software development methodology, a response to the interdependency between development and operations, a poorly executed scam, an extension of the lean startup revolution and a natural reaction to cloud infrastructure and virtualisation. People search Google and buy DevOps in a box from $395 per year. DevOps is a culture of collaboration and if something on your production stack breaks in the middle of the night then you should DevOps it. If your app locks up in performance test then that's DevOps. Most importantly, any modern Project Manager knows that no Agile team is complete without a DevOps- and good developers can do DevOps. Some developers even do DevOps full time. DevOps is the new normal.
