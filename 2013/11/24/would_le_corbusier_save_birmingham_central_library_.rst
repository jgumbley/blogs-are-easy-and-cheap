Would Le Corbusier save Birmingham Central Library?
===================================================

    A clean, unmodified Central Library on a sunny day in 1982. [#]_.

Birmingham Central Library was completed in 1974, the eastern bound of a much larger civic centre which has never been completed. Less than forty years later, in 2013, the building has been emptied of its precious horde of books and historical achives. The building now functions as nothing more than a massive decaying concrete roof over a tacky and windy downscale row of shops and cafes.  Despite the best efforts of English Heritage, the 20th Centry Society and a cadre of passionate objecters, the building is scheduled for demolition. 

A humanist, cubist, modernist building for the future.

     The history of Architecture unfolds itself slowly across the centuries as a modification of structure and ornament, but in the last fifty years steel and concrete have brought new conquests, which are the index of a greater capacity for construction, and of an architecture in which the old codes have been overturned.
-- Le Corbusier, Towards an Architecture, 1923

Destructruction of what went before
-----------------------------------

The old library.
Other buildings.


    The “styles” are a lie. Style is a unity of principle animating all the work of an epoch, the result of a state of mind which has its own special character.


    We throw the out-of-date tool on the scrap-heap: the carbine, the culverin, the growler and the old locomotive. This action is a manifestation of health, of moral health, of morale also; it is not right that we should produce bad things because of a bad tool; nor is it right that we should waste our energy, our health and our courage because of a bad tool; it must be thrown away and replaced.

    Without a plan, you have lack of order, and wilfulness. Without plan there can be neither grandeur of aim and expression, nor rhythm, nor mass, nor coherence. Rhythm is a state of equilibrium which proceeds either from symmetries, simple or complex, or from delicate balancings.
