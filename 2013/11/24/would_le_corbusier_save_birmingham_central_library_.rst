Would Le Corbusier save Birmingham Central Library?
===================================================

    A clean, unmodified Central Library on a sunny day in 1982. [#]_.

Birmingham Central Library was completed in 1974, the eastern bound of a much larger civic centre which has never been completed. Less than forty years later, in 2013, the building has been emptied of its precious horde of books and historical achives. The building now functions as nothing more than a massive decaying concrete roof over a tacky and windy downscale row of shops and cafes.  Despite the best efforts of English Heritage, the 20th Centry Society and a cadre of passionate objecters [#]_, the building is scheduled for demolition. 

A humanist, cubist, modernist building for the future.
------------------------------------------------------
     In the last fifty years steel and concrete have brought new conquests, which are the index of a greater capacity for construction, and of an architecture in which the old codes have been overturned.
-- Le Corbusier, Towards an Architecture, 1923

Architect John Madin had a vision for the future.
The town was growing fast.
The pre-war city was decimated by the war.
It was an industrial city with lots of poverty.
The librarian shared the vision.
Had a view into the future, understood computerisation, the wider remit of a library.

Le Corbusier was a architectural prophet. 
Town planning was an emerging humanist art.
The architect was to be the savior of the city.
The champion of the simple and unadorned, ever mindful of mass, surface and restraining lines.
Against a garden.

The vision Le Corbusier foretold was domination of the automobile.
Understood the fumes and filth of the things would suffocate the city.
His solution was a traffic graded metropolis.
Buildings would be suspended atop polis, columns with vehicles running beneath.
The pedestrian segmented from the subterranean zone of cars, utilities, sewage pipes.

    The original plan echoed Le Corbusier's vision of a city raised above the ground, with a bus station planned in a subterranean zone alongside the current road tunnels. [#]_

A fly in the ointment of the natural order of the city
------------------------------------------------------
    Without plan there can be neither grandeur of aim and expression, nor rhythm, nor mass, nor coherence. 
-- Le Corbusier, Towards an Architecture, 1923

Yep yep.
Inner ringroad.

Destruction of what went before
-------------------------------
    The “styles” are a lie. Style is a unity of principle animating all the work of an epoch, the result of a state of mind which has its own special character.
-- Le Corbusier, Towards an Architecture, 1923

The old library.
Other buildings.

Conclusion
----------
    We throw the out-of-date tool on the scrap-heap: the carbine, the culverin, the growler and the old locomotive. This action is a manifestation of health, of moral health, of morale also; it is not right that we should produce bad things because of a bad tool; nor is it right that we should waste our energy, our health and our courage because of a bad tool; it must be thrown away and replaced.
-- Le Corbusier, Towards an Architecture, 1923

The thing is a mess.
