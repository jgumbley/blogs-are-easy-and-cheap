Fred Field, and Frederick Field Snr.
====================================

Time is a very strange thing. I was talking to my Gran who is almost 90 years old recently. She said as a child things that happened two hundred years ago felt extremely far in the past. Now she has has been alive for almost half that period of time. In terms of the evolution of the species or exchange of family traits, 200 years is a heartbeat or a blink of the eye. Either way- given the political and technological currents which animate the world, the near past can enrich and illuminate things.

    Time is hard to fathom.

My grandfather died in the 90s. I remember him quite well, but mainly from my experiences with him as a boy and the things that my Mom and Gran have told me about him. He was a tall man, born in Birmingham to a working class family and married to a devoted wife. He was father to two girls and a much younger son.

Fred was a committed trade-union organiser at the Longbridge factory, a keen gardener and the keeper of an aviary of budgerigars. His biggest vice from what I can tell was smoking, which probably eventually contributed to his death. My family recall him as a moral, thoughtful and dilligent man.  To my mother he was a key inspiration to her career as a teacher of kids in inner city Birmingham.  After her retirement his memory was a spur to do voluntary work with vulnerable people.

    My grandad Fred liked Budgies

I've been working in central Birmingham for the past year. Although a familiar place, after living in lots of other places it's been interesting to see where my family originated. 

Birmingham was one of the very first global industrial centres. This was due to its proximity to raw materials and access to international markets through the Empire. When the Industrial Revolution took hold Birmingham's population exploded in a manner repeated many times since across the globe. 

Unsurpisingly, young people from the countryside travelled to Birmingham and other industrial cities to find work, and to prevent starvation. Enterprenuers, capitalists and landowners were building workshops, canals, railways, factories, banks and rows of cheap densely packed housing. Birmingham was known as the workshop of the world during this time and produced metal goods in quantities unseen before.

    Birmingham was undergoing somewhat of an industrial revolution at the time.

The censuses are extraordinarily detailed catalogues of the urban populace of this time. Kept at least in part as an inventory of the British Empire's potential might for colonial expansion and defence, each man, woman and child is recorded along with their profession or trade, address, age and details as to any mental deficiency. 

Tracing this lineage back is somewhat tricky not least due to the very common names which my ancesters had. For example my Great-Grandmother Lily Jones was one of eleven Lily Joneses in the city at the time and one of three who were born in the same year. However, by correlating details in the living memory such as addresses and the names of siblings it is possible to find my both my Great-Grandparents in the census of 1911. From there I've traced back to 1901, 1891, 1881 and occasionally, and with great care, to the censuses of the mid-nineteenth century when the Industrial Revolution in Birmingham was at its peak.

    Most of the census documents are available on the Internet for a price.

One impression I could draw from the censuses is that Birmingham had a class of metalworkers and gunmakers who lived in densely packed rented accommodation, that women, especially girls participated in the work, involvement in the trade was regularly passed from generation to generation, marriages were frequently to people who lived on the next street, and lots of children died before they reached school age.

Illustrating this, my Grandfather Fred's Grandfather (Thomas) was born in 1861 and worked as a Nail Caster (these would be individually cast nails, before modern wire nails were developed). He lived on Vincent Street near Small Heath in 1891 with his wife in a back-to-back house and seems to have lost several young children between the 1881 and 1891 censuses. 

Similarly, Thomas Pennell, my Grandmother's Great Grandfather was born in 1831 and worked as a Gun Maker (one of the really significant industries in the city at the time). He lived in the St George district in 1861 with his wife in a back-to-back house and seems to have lost several children between the 1851 and 1861 censuses. Both of these Thomases would have descendants whom continued to live their lives in the area around Small Heath.

    This is from the barrel shop at BSA, probably early 20th century, but is illustrative.

My Grandparents married in the late 1940s after the disruption of the Second World War. In the common manner of the time my Grandparents went to live with my Granddad Fred's parents Lily and Frederick Snr. Finding this out made me ask my Grandmother what she remembers about my Grandfather's parents and the time she and Fred spent living with them  right after they had married. 

I suppose my assumption was that Fred's Dad was the template of his son, idealistic and determined, upright and inspirational. Sadly no, my Grandmother tells me that my Grandad's Dad was 'a horrible man', albeit a dapper and intruiging one, who seemingly never had any money, could be a pain in the bum, and liked a drink a little too much.

He was born in 1891 to Thomas and Elisabeth Field. They were both in their 30s and lived in Windsor Place, a complex of back-to-back houses set around a 'court' on Vincent Street, in the Balsall Heath area Birmingham. Frederick had three elder siblings, Herbert, who was 7 when he was born, Thomas, who was 4 and Annie who was 3 years old. 

In 1911, by the time Fred was 20 years old, his older sister Annie had died and he had three additional brothers and sisters, Leonard, Winnefred and Beatrice. The cast nail industry was by this time going into decline and Fred Snr's father, now 50 years of age still worked in that industry. His two elder brothers, Herbert and Leonard were metalworkers also and had moved out of the family home.

The backdrop of this time was the rise of German industry as a competitor to that of Britain, the rise of Imperial Germany and the insane devastation of the First World War. One thing the British Empire did incredibly well was records and Fred's war records have been preserved (many were burned) and provide an incredible window into his life between 1918 and around 1930.

    Fred was living here when he enlisted.

Fred was conscripted in 1918, four years into the war. Many of the 'pals regiments' who marched off to volenteer in 1914 would have been dead by this stage so perhaps this shows some good sense. Fred lists his place of abode as the 'Rowton House' in Central Birmingham, a 6d per night hostelry for Navvies, Irish and "down and outs". He joins the Tank Corps Central Workshops and is listed as 5’2” tall (his son was 6'1") with a 'Girth when fully expanded' of 37".

    This is a picture of the Central Workshops in 1917.

Luckily the war was over by the end of the year, however Fred was retained in Tank Corps into 1919. Amazingly his courtship and marriage to his wife is documented through a leave request from January 1919 which is evidenced by a copy of his marriage certificate. The certificate shows his wedding to Lily Jones, my Great Grandmother, whom must have been pregnant at the wedding as Lillian Rosamund Field was born seven months later on 1 Jul 1919. Sadly their first child died after only one day in this world.

    Here he is. I think with his sister?
