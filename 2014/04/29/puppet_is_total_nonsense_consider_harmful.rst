Puppet is total nonsense. Consider harmful.
===========================================

Knuth quote

Owe puppet. Credentialise. First used 2009. Work for global software consultancies as a 'continuous delivery' consultant. Apply puppet and the methodologies to projects of national importance. Used puppet to install, Scala apps, Java apps, websphere, jboss, rails apps python apps, even oracle. Used puppet with a master, puppet masterless, puppetdb, heira, hieragpg.

Puppet is a sprawling mess that has evolved according to no well defined path. Development has been spordoradic and path dependant. This is the way of things, the right shape of tool has emerged from the requriements in use.  

Currently working on a project which requires 'enablement'

Explaining there is no rational or good reason why syntax is a certain way (examples)

Node classification. Then ENCs. Then hiera. 

Puppetdb. Idea is great but the implementation is all wrong.

Random order of running. Wtf.

Second mover advantage.

Learn that 6 figure salaries.

If you are an architect or technical leader on a project - don't you will throw hours down the drain.

If you are a engineer with a current specialism then start to learn other tools.

If you are just learning then start with other tools.

Like goto statements or procaryotic cells Puppet served an evolutionary use, but simpler more well factored tools will now dominate.
